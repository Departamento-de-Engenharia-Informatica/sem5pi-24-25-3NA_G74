Projeto Integrador LAPR5 - Surgical Appointment and Resource Management

## Scope

The scope of this project is to develop a prototype system for chirurgic requests, appointment,
and resource management. The system will enable hospitals and clinics to manage surgery
appointments, and patient records. It will also offer real-time 3D visualization of resource
availability within the facility and optimize scheduling and resource usage. Furthermore, the
project will address GDPR compliance, ensuring the system meets data protection and consent
management requirements.
Each module of the system must consider the legal aspects of the GDPR Regulation (EU)
2016/679 and guarantee that users can access the privacy policy and exercise all relevant rights
under this regulation.
Since this is a prototype, not all modules will need full implementation. The project proposal
must clearly specify which functionalities are implemented.
Given that the project spans 14 weeks, broken into three sprints, it is important to carefully
allocate tasks, milestones, and responsibilities to ensure that the students can develop a working
system by the end of the course. Each sprint will include a planning phase, development phase,
testing, and review.

## Overview

In this project, you will develop a web-based surgical appointment and resource management
system. The system will consist of several modules:
- Backoffice Web Application
- 3D Visualization Module
- Planning/Optimization Module
- GDPR Module
- Business Continuity Plan (BCP)

The goal is to expose students to full-stack web development, REST APIs, database management,
3D rendering, optimization using Prolog, and privacy law (GDPR).
You will work in groups of 4, with each group member responsible for different parts of the
system. Each student will be responsible for a distinct part of the system, but collaboration is
essential for integrating the various components into a functional product. All user stories across
the modules must align, and any dependencies between modules (e.g., 3D visualization relying
on scheduling data from the planning module) must be carefully managed.
