Definition of Ready (DoR)

The Definition of Ready establishes the criteria that a User Story or backlog item must meet before it is accepted for development.
A User Story is "ready" when:

    Clarity:
        The User Story is fully described, with clear context and purpose (e.g., "As Admin, I want to update an allergy, so that I can keep the information accurate and up-to-date").
        The Acceptance Criteria are well-defined and reviewed (e.g., field validation, error messages, access permissions).

    Breakdown into Tasks:
        The User Story has been broken down into clear, estimable technical tasks.

    Scope Validation:
        All business requirements have been clarified with the Product Owner or equivalent.
        There are no outstanding questions about the expected behavior.

    Design and Technical Details:
        Technical issues or external dependencies have been discussed and resolved.
        The data model has been reviewed, if necessary.

    Test Acceptance Criteria:
        Test scenarios have been defined and approved (including validation, edge cases, and permissions).

    Prioritization and Estimation:
        The User Story is prioritized in the backlog.
        The team has provided an estimate (story points or hours).

Definition of Done (DoD)

The Definition of Done defines what needs to be completed for a User Story or backlog item to be considered finished.
A User Story is "done" when:

    Development:
        All the code needed to implement the functionality has been written, reviewed, and adheres to team standards.
        The functionality has been tested locally and works as expected.

    Automated Tests:
        Unit tests have been implemented and meet a minimum coverage of X% (defined by the team).
        Integration and end-to-end tests have been implemented and pass successfully.

    Requirement Validation:
        All Acceptance Criteria have been met.

    Code Quality:
        Code has been reviewed as part of a code review process.
        There are no known high-priority bugs.
        Logs and error messages have been implemented, are clear, and avoid exposing sensitive information.

    Documentation:
        Technical documentation or system updates (e.g., Swagger for APIs or internal guides) have been completed.
        The behavior of the feature has been documented for stakeholders, if necessary.

    Deployment:
        The feature has been merged into the main branch without conflicts.
        The deployment has been completed (to a staging or production environment, depending on the cycle).
        The feature has been validated in the correct environment.
