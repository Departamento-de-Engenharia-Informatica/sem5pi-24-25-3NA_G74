Azure SQL Database incorporates comprehensive business continuity and disaster recovery capabilities to ensure data 
protection and service availability. The database is protected through multiple automated backup mechanisms, including 
full, differential, and transaction log backups, which are stored in geo-redundant storage.

The system provides multiple layers of protection against different types of failures. For local hardware or software 
issues, the database maintains high availability through its built-in architecture. Zone redundancy can be enabled to 
protect against datacenter-level failures by maintaining synchronized copies across multiple availability zones within 
the same region.

In the event of data corruption or accidental deletion, the database can be restored to any previous point within the 
retention period using Point-in-Time Restore. For organizations requiring extended retention periods, Long-Term 
Retention policies can be configured to preserve backups for several years.

For protection against regional outages, three primary disaster recovery options are available:

Failover Groups represent the recommended approach, maintaining a synchronized copy of the database in a secondary 
region. During an outage, failover can be triggered automatically or manually, with minimal disruption to applications 
as connection strings remain unchanged.

Active Geo-replication provides similar protection by maintaining readable secondary copies in different regions, 
offering flexibility in failover management at the database level.

Geo-restore capabilities allow for database recovery using geo-replicated backups, creating a new database instance on 
any existing server in any Azure region. While this option requires more time for recovery, it serves as a reliable 
fallback method.

Proper preparation of the secondary region is essential for efficient recovery. This includes configuring security 
settings, firewall rules, and necessary permissions. Regular testing of failover procedures helps ensure smooth 
operation during actual emergencies. Through these mechanisms, the database maintains resilience against various types 
of failures while minimizing potential business disruption.
